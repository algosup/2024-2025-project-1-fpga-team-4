#### What is Frogger

Frogger is an arcade game, developed by Konami and published in 1981 by Sega, which was really popular when it was realsed and was said to be "one of the greatest video game ever made".

#### How to Play

The goal of the game is to direct a frog to his home by dodging traffic on a road.
The frog starts at the bottom of the screen and the player must guide the frog to the top of the screen, across the opposite lanes of traffic without getting killed by cars.

#### Project Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|---|---|
|Delivering a working game inspired by Frogger using the Go Board|Additional levels beyond level 10|
|Implementing game logic in Verilog[^2] to run on the Go Board and display on a VGA monitor|Multiplayer system|
|Win and lose conditions|Sound effects or music|
|Go Board must be used to control the frog and display the score|Advanced graphics|

## II. Game Mechanics

#### Controls
The player controls are four different buttons that are used to navigate the frog, each button causes the frog to hop once in that direction, switch 1 = up, switch 2 = down, switch 3 = left and switch 4 = right. 

On the bottom of the screen the player must guide the frog between opposing lanes of trucks, cars, and buses, to avoid dying.

#### Map and Vehicules Mechanics 

##### The Map:
- The bottom part of the screen serves as the starting area for the player.
- This section of the map represents a busy highway filled with multiple lanes of moving vehicles.
- Vehicles include different types of cars and trucks of varying speeds and sizes. They move horizontally from left to right or right to left across the screen.

##### Vehicules Mechanics:
- Vehicules move horizontally across the screen, either left to right or right to left.
- Each vehicule have a spawnrate[^3] and set speed, which can vary depending on the level or difficulty.
- The vehicules continuously respawns to maintain the flow of traffic. 
- Each vehicule has a defined hitbox that matches its size on the grid.
- Vehicules types:
    - Cars : They can be either slow or fast (2 - 3 boxes per second) and take up 1 grid space.
    - Buses : They are slow (1 boxes per second), taking up 2 grid spaces.
    - Trucks : They are fast (2 boxes per second), taking up 3 grid spaces.

#### Scoring System
When the player reaches the top of the screen, his score is updated and a point is added to it. 

The player's goal is to reach the maximum score of 10 points without dying. After reaching the maximum score the game stops and the letters "GG" are displayed on the board.

## IV. Use Cases

#### Use Case N°1: Start Game
- **Description**: The player starts the game.
- **Actor(s)**: Player, Game System
- **Pre-Conditions**: The game is installed and launched.
- **Flow of Events**:
    - Player presses "Start".
    - The game system initializes the level.
    - The frog appears at the starting position at the bottom of the screen.
    - The game system begins movement of obstacles (cars, logs, etc.).
- **Post-Conditions**: The player can control the frog; obstacles are in motion.
- **Exit Criteria**: The game is now playable.

#### Use Case N°2: Navigating through the road
- **Description**: The player interacts with the game environment.
- **Actor(s)**: Player, Game System
- **Pre-Conditions**: The game has started, and the player is controlling the frog.
- **Flow of Events**:
    - The player presses a switch on the GO-Board to move the frog.
    - The game system moves the frog in the indicated direction.
    - The game system checks for collisions between the frog and moving cars/trucks.
- **Post-Conditions**: The frog moves as directed by player inputs.
- **Exit Criteria**: The frog safely crosses the road or collides with an obstacle.
 
#### Use Case N°3: Finishing a Level
- **Description**: Completing the game's objective.
- **Actor(s)**: Player, Game System
- **Pre-Conditions**: The player successfully navigates the frog across the road.
- **Flow of Events**:
The frog reaches the top of the screen.
- **Post-Conditions**: The player's score is updated, and the frog's position  is reset to the starting position.
- **Exit Criteria**: The player finishes the level, and the game transitions to the next level.

#### Use Case N°4: Win the Game
- **Description**: The player successfully reaches a score of 10.
- **Actor(s)**: Player, Game System
- **Pre-Conditions**: The player has reached the last level.
- **Flow of Events**:
    - The player guides the frog to the end in the last level.
    - The game system displays the letters "GG" on the Go-Board.
- **Post-Conditions**: The player wins the game and sees a victory screen.
- **Exit Criteria**: The game resets to the initial state.

#### Use Case N°5: Game Over
- **Description**: Ending the game after dying.
- **Actor(s)**: Player, Game System
- **Pre-Conditions**: The player collides with a car.
- **Flow of Events**:
    - The game system detects the collision.
    - When the frog dies, the game transitions to a "Game Over" screen.
    - The game displays the final score and a prompt to restart or quit the game.
- **Post-Conditions**: The game ends, game over message, final score on the board.
- **Exit Criteria**: The game resets to the initial state.

## V. Requirements and Objectives 

#### 1. Requirements

- ##### Frog Display Requirements 
The frog shall be drawn as a 1x1 grid on the VGA display (where each grid is 32x32 pixels). The frog shall be white in color. 

- ##### Car Display Requirements
There shall be at least 1 car on the screen at a time. The car shall be drawn as a 1x1 grid. The car shall be white in color. 

- ##### Levels Requirements
There shall be at least 1 level in the game, when the Frog reaches the top of the screen the game is complete. 

#### 2. Objectives 

- ##### Frog Display Objectives
The frog shall be drawn as a Sprite[^4] that looks like a real frog. The Sprite shall have colors. 

- ##### Car Display Objectives
There shall be up to 16 cars on the screen at a time. The cars shall have the ability to move at different speeds.

- ##### Levels Objectives
There shall be at least 10 levels in the game, when the level increases the game difficulty gets harder (for example, cars speed increase, number of cars increase).

## VI. Test Plan
Anything relative to this project's tests can be found in [this document](./TestPlan.md).

## VII. Success Criteria

Those are our succes criteria:

- The game display every element without any kind of stuttering
- The player can control the character without latency between the player action and game's reaction using the Go Board
- The player can progress amongst levels the same way as the original game
- The game does not return errors on launch
- The game does not crashes
- The player can loose and win if conditions are met.

## IX. Legal

In this project, we are remaking the Frogger game on a Go Board (FPGA[^5]) for educational purposes. As this is a school project, we are not using any of the original game’s assets, names, or code to avoid legal issues. All graphics, sounds, and game logics are original or designed by the team. Here are the key guidelines:

 - Intellectual Property: We are not copying any original Frogger assets or elements. Instead, we’re creating our own designs, including the frog, cars, and environment.
 - Gameplay Inspiration: While the gameplay mechanics are inspired by Frogger, the implementation and design are our own. This ensures that we remain within fair use for educational purposes.
 - Trademark Avoidance: The name “Frogger” will not be used in the final version of the project. The game will be renamed, and no trademarks from the original game are to be included.
 - Educational Exemption: This project is non-commercial and solely for educational purposes, which provides some leeway under copyright laws.
