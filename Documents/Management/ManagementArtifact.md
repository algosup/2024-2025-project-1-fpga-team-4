## MoSCoW

The MoSCoW method is a prioritisation technique used in management, business analysis, project management, and software development to reach a common understanding with stakeholders on the importance they place on the delivery of each requirement; it is also known as MoSCoW prioritisation or MoSCoW analysis.
