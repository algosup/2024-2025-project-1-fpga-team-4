**Responsible**: Those who are responsible for the correct completion of the task; <br>
**Accountable**: The one that must sign off (approve) work that the Responsible provides; <br>
**Consulted**: Those whose opinions are sought, typically subject-matter experts, and with whom there is a two-way communication; <br>
**Informed**: Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task or deliverable, and with whom there is just a one-way communication; <br>

## MoSCoW

The MoSCoW method is a prioritisation technique used in management, business analysis, project management, and software development to reach a common understanding with stakeholders on the importance they place on the delivery of each requirement; it is also known as MoSCoW prioritisation or MoSCoW analysis.
